 SSP (System Structure and Parameterization) is a standard currently developed as a Modelica Association Project.
 It allows the simulation of several linked FMU (Functional Mockup Unit)
 
 RaspInLoop uses FMU in co-simulation to permit to the java debugger to interract with the simulation.
 So linking the FMU exported from Raspinloop config to a ssp file, you will be able to perform a 'debuggable' simulation.
